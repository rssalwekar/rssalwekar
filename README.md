## About Me

I’m a computer science and data science double-major at UNC Charlotte, deeply passionate about building high-performance, mathematically rigorous systems. My work spans machine learning research, algorithmic simulation, and distributed system design.

- Currently conducting research in the UNC Charlotte Machine Learning Lab, focusing on **sparse neural networks**, **model efficiency**, and **optimization**.
- Previously worked on **Bitcoin Lightning Network simulation**, developing a Go-based routing simulator with probabilistic algorithms and running large-scale Monte Carlo analyses.
- Experienced in building full-stack applications, AI-powered tools, and data systems through internships and personal projects.

My technical strengths: Python, PyTorch / NumPy, Go, probabilistic modeling, algorithmic design, numerical optimization, and systems-level thinking.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I’m most proud of — a mix of research, algorithms, and web / app work:

- **ln-pathfinding-module**: A Go-based simulator for Lightning Network routing. Simulates payment routing under liquidity uncertainty, integrates probabilistic pathfinding, and benchmarks different routing strategies.

- **LeetCode**: My personal repository for LeetCode problems — demonstrates problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, and performance tuning.

- **cci-startup-hackathon**: Web app built during a hackathon — full-stack experience, prototyping, rapid development, and deployment.

- **ballon-dor-llm-dashboard**: Dashboard built for a coding assignment using LLMs; interactive UI + backend integration, showcasing LLM prompt design, inference, and visualization.
