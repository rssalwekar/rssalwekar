## About Me

I am a computer science and data science double-major at UNC Charlotte with interests in machine learning, algorithms, and systems development. I enjoy working on projects that are mathematically grounded and efficient in practice.

I am currently conducting research in the UNC Charlotte Machine Learning Lab, focusing on sparse neural networks, model efficiency, and optimization. This includes developing differentiable pruning methods in PyTorch and NumPy and studying the computational tradeoffs involved.

Earlier, I worked on Bitcoin Lightning Network simulation where I built a Go-based payment routing simulator, incorporated probabilistic extensions of Dijkstra’s algorithm, and ran large-scale Monte Carlo evaluations using live network data.

Outside of research, I have experience building full-stack applications, AI-powered tools, and data-driven systems through internships and personal projects. My technical background includes Python, Go, PyTorch, NumPy, probabilistic modeling, algorithmic design, and systems-level development.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I have worked on:

- **ln-pathfinding-module**: A Go-based simulator for Lightning Network routing. Models payment routing under liquidity uncertainty, integrates probabilistic pathfinding, and benchmarks multiple routing strategies.

- **LeetCode**: My personal repository for algorithm and data structure practice. It contains a growing collection of problems and solutions.

- **cci-startup-hackathon**: A full-stack web application built during a hackathon. Focuses on rapid prototyping and deployment.

- **ballon-dor-llm-dashboard**: A dashboard built for an LLM-based assignment with an interactive interface and backend logic for running and analyzing model outputs.
